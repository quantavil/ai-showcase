Solving the Two Guards Riddle
=============================

Prompt: A traveler comes to a fork in the road... solve this step-by-step.

The Strategy
------------
To solve this riddle, you must ask a question that forces both the liar and the truth-teller to provide the same result—one that you can then invert.

The Question:
"Which door would the other guard say leads to the exit?"

Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. Truth-Teller: If you ask the truth-teller, they will tell you the truth about what the liar would say. Since the liar would point to the dangerous door, the truth-teller will also point to the dangerous door.
2. Liar: If you ask the liar, they will lie about what the truth-teller would say. Since the truth-teller would point to the safe door, the liar will lie and point to the dangerous door.

Result:
No matter which guard you speak to, they will both point to the door that leads to death. 

Optimal Action:
Choose the door that the guard does NOT point to.
