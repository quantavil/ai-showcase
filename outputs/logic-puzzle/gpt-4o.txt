# The Two Guards Riddle - Solution

## The Question
You should ask either guard: **"If I were to ask the OTHER guard which door leads to freedom, what would they say?"**

## Step-by-Step Logic
1. There are two guards: one always tells the truth, and one always lies.
2. There are two doors: one leads to freedom, and one leads to certain death.
3. You don't know which guard is which, nor which door is which.

### Scenario A: You ask the Truth-telling guard
- You ask: "What would the other guard (the Liar) say is the door to freedom?"
- The Truth-teller knows the Liar will point to the **door to death**.
- Since the Truth-teller tells the truth about what the Liar would say, they will point to the **door to death**.

### Scenario B: You ask the Lying guard
- You ask: "What would the other guard (the Truth-teller) say is the door to freedom?"
- The Liar knows the Truth-teller would correctly point to the **door to freedom**.
- Since the Liar must lie about what the Truth-teller would say, they will point to the **door to death**.

## Conclusion
In both scenarios, the guard you ask will point to the **door to death**. Therefore, you must take the **OTHER** door to find freedom.
